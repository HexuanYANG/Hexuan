    "- **SMB**: is the return on a diversified portfolio of small stocks minus the return on a diversified portfolio of big stocks. Historically, small-cap stocks have outperformed large-cap stocks, and SMB captures this size effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HML**: captures the spread in returns between stocks with high book-to-market ratios (value stocks) and low book-to-market ratios (growth stocks). Historically, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks, and HML quantifies this value effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "- **CMA**: is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of the stocks of low and high investment firms, which we call conservative and aggressive. Historically, stocks with more conservative accounting practices have outperformed those with aggressive practices, and CMA quantifies this conservatism factor.\n",

    "- **BAB factor**: is a portfolio that holds low-beta assets, leveraged to a beta of one, and that shorts high-beta assets, de-leveraged to a beta of one. BAB factors have a positive average return and that the return is increasing in the ex ante tightness of constraints and in the spread in betas between high- and low-beta securities. Therefore, during times of tightening funding liquidity constraints, the BAB factor realizes negative returns as its expected future return rises. Contrary to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which suggests higher beta implies higher returns, BAB suggests that low-beta stocks tend to outperform high-beta stocks.\n",

Historically, stocks of companies with lower investment have tended to outperform those with higher investment, and IA captures this investment efficiency factor.\n",

Companies with higher ROE are often associated with higher stock returns, indicating the importance of profitability in stock performance.\n",
